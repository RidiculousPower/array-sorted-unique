Initial release - split from compositing-unique-array.

## 6/30/2012 ##

Renamed from sorted-unique-array to array-sorted-unique. File schema updated to reflect gem name.

## 11/24/2012 ##

Updated for fake Array inheritance support since inheriting from Array prevents #to_a from being called at splat.
